## 🧪 API Testing: Identifying Defects in Product Data

_(Generated by ChatGPT)_

### **Task**
Develop automated tests to validate data provided by a public API in order to detect errors and anomalies.

---

### **Tools**
- [CursorAI](https://cursor.sh/) or **ChatGPT** — for generating test scenarios
- [ReqBin](https://reqbin.com/) or **Postman** — for executing API requests
- **API Endpoint**: [`https://fakestoreapi.com/products`](https://fakestoreapi.com/products)

---

### **Initial Data**
A `GET` request to `https://fakestoreapi.com/products` returns an **array of product objects**.

> ⚠️ The returned JSON data contains **intentional defects** that must be identified.

---

### **Test Objectives**
1. ✅ Verify **HTTP response status** is `200 OK`
2. ✅ Confirm each product has the following valid attributes:
  - `title` (product name) — **must not be empty**
  - `price` — **must not be negative**
  - `rating.rate` — **must not exceed 5**

---

### **Expected Output**
Generate a list of **products containing any defects** based on the criteria above.
